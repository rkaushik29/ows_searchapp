# ows_searchapp
Example search application for OpenWebSearch. Created using Lucene and JS.

### CIFF Import & Export
- First, make a CIFF index by using an export (for example, from Anserini) by following the instructions in this README: https://github.com/informagi/lucene-ciff 
- From the above repository, run the application to import the CIFF index to Lucene.

### Create Application
- With the imported Lucene index, a search application can be made (such as in this repository) in any language.
